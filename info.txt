Description:

The app was developed for Members to be able to search one another.
You must be a member and authenticated to do so.
You may opt out by going to your profile page.
You have two ways to search:
1) By username, obscode, or last name. App performs a lookup against the hq_Person Table
2) By your address on file, a user inputted location, or lat long. You are required to input a search radius as well.
If a user inputs multiple entries for search type 2, the priority in which is searches is top to bottom.
This app has an external dependency on pygeocoder to look up location inputs
No data is set to tables in this app. Forms are only used to query against tables. All forms should remain GET requests therfore.

Happy Searching

The membersearch branch was created in 10/2015. By 4/2017 it was so out-of-sync with
the master that its functional content was hand merged into the membersearch2 
branch.
