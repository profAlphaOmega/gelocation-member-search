On behalf of the AAVSO staff and council, it is a pleasure to welcome you to the AAVSO family! 

We would like to offer any assistance we can, and answer any questions you may have. Please let
us know if you'd like help setting up an observing program or if you need more information on 
our community’s forums and mailing lists, or how you can publish your work in our journal (JAAVSO). 

If you are a new observer, I particularly encourage you to use our Mentorship program; we will 
find a member of our community who can give you information on variable stars, provide advice 
and feedback on observing variable stars and will help you set up your own observing program.

Our database, including more than 30,000 objects with observations that span more than a century, 
always welcomes new observations. Our data are being used by the scientific community and your 
contribution (visual, PEP, DSLR or CCD) is greatly valued by our esteemed academic colleagues.

Please access your new member kit, which includes the AAVSO Bylaws, Annual Report, a recent copy
of the Journal (JAAVSO), observing manuals and much more, through this unique DropBox location:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ateqm3nq9jxrvy2/AADdrmOwkKyHezTAcp9-_nQ5a?oref=e&n=351631456

Your AAVSO membership certificate should arrive in the mail within four weeks of joining. If you
do not receive it in that time, please let me know right away. 

You can also share your ideas and keep up with your new AAVSO community by liking our Facebook page:

or following us on Twitter:

If there is anything we can do to help you, please feel free to contact us. We can be reached by 
phone at 617-354-0484, (9:00am-4:00pm EDT Monday through Friday) or by email at aavso@aavso.org.

Finally, I hope to have the chance to meet you in person in the future, perhaps in one of our 
meetings. I appreciate having you as member of our family!

Best wishes – clear skies,
Stella Kafka, AAVSO Director
