On behalf of the AAVSO staff and Council I want to thank you for renewing 
your membership with the AAVSO. As a nonprofit organization, membership fees
support our core mission and our staff who deliver quality programming and
support. You are part of an international community of astronomers both 
amateur and professional who are leading the world in variable star astronomy. 

Please click this link to retrieve your exclusive 2018 AAVSO membership logo,
which can be used on your web page or email signature:

For more than one hundred years, we have trained observers, educated the 
public and curated a rich database of nearly 30,000 variable objects. Our 
data routinely appear in scientific manuscripts, our observers are frequently
called to support space-based observations, our manuals and software are 
commonly used in classrooms and by astronomy clubs for information and 
training. Our charts and sequences are in high demand by observers all 
over the world, and VSX is widely used by the astronomical community as 
a resource of up-to-date information on variable stars. All these – and 
even more – are supported by your active participation and membership. 

You might also consider adopting a variable star as a gift through our 
Adopt a Variable Star Program. On our website’s home page simply click
under “Support the AAVSO”. You will be directed to a web form where 
you can “adopt” any variable star listed in VSX for one year, for a 
donation to the AAVSO of ${{ADOPT_COST}}.00 US (tax-deductible in the US).

You will receive a star chart of that variable star and a certificate showing
either your name or the name of the person you specify on it. Also, at the 
end of your year you will receive a light curve of your star for that year. 

I encourage you to contact headquarters staff if you need assistance or have
any suggestions for future programming. Thank you again for renewing your 
AAVSO membership.

Best wishes – clear skies,

Stella Kafka, PhD
AAVSO Director
